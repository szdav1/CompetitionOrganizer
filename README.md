# Fence!
> A basic, minimal software that helps to conduct fencing competitions.
---
> The goal of the project is to **help smaller fencing associations by making it easier for them to do a home competition.**
> It tries to achieve this by offering simple, easy to use UI, an offline "database" system where fencers can be stored
> and minimal system requirements so that it can run well on an older device too.
---
## The softwre features:
- Poules
- Tables
- Whole competitions

> It can handle Poule only competitions, where after the poule is done, the competition ends.
> The same applies for Table only competitions.
> Of course, it can handle whole competitions too.
---
## But how does this help?
> Fencing associations that do home competitions usually use paper for it. Paper costs money, and every data needs to be calculated by someone.
> This takes time and the person who manages the poules and tables must have some experience, and know how fencing competitions work.
> But the user of this software only needs to know how the software works.
> Entering  data into the poules, calculating the data after a poule ends, sorting the fencers and than puting them into a table, all this is done
> by the software.
